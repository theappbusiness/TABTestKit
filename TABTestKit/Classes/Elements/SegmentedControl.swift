	/// Unfortunately it's not possibble to give UISegmentedControls an accessibilityLabel or identifier in code,
	/// so you can only find segmented controls by index. Generally there's only one segmented control on a screen anyway,
	/// so for the most part this is unlikely to be an issue.
	///
	/// You could always wrap it in a custom view that has an identifier and set that element as the parent.
	///
	/// - Parameters:
	///   - index: The index of the segmented control. Defaults to 0, meaning the first segmented control.
	///   - parent: The parent element of the SegmentedControl. Defaults to the app.
