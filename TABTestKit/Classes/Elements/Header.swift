	/// In iOS 13 (and maybe above), UILabels are always referenced by XCUI as `.staticText`, even if they have the `.header` trait available.
	/// Frustratingly, this isn't the case for other views with the `.header` trait (like `UITableView` section headers), so we cannot just change
	/// the element's `type` to `.staticText`, because it will fail in some other cases.
	///
	/// The way we've worked around this is to find _all_ elements matching the provided ID,
	/// and then use a private API to get the underlying accessibility traits of the view the XCUIElement represents and filter all
	/// of the matched elements by the ones that have the `.header` trait.
	///
	/// We then retrieve the header by index (if it exists), if not it defaults to the standard query for the underlying `XCUIElement`
	/// so that we can still check if an element doesn't exist without crashing the tests.
